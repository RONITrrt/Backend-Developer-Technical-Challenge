This is a Node.js-based School Management System that uses MongoDB Atlas for database operations. It provides functionality to manage and store school-related data efficiently, leveraging modern technologies.

Features
User-friendly school data management system.
Secure MongoDB Atlas database connection.
Structured backend using Express.js.
Real-time updates and efficient API handling.
Scalable architecture for future enhancements.
Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (v14+ recommended)
NPM (Node Package Manager)
MongoDB Atlas Account (for database configuration)
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/school-management-system.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd school-management-system
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Configuration
Create a .env file in the root directory and add your MongoDB Atlas connection string:

php
Copy code
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/<database>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
PORT=5000
Replace the placeholders:

<username>: Your MongoDB Atlas username.
<password>: Your MongoDB Atlas password.
<database>: The database name you want to use.
Whitelist your IP in the MongoDB Atlas dashboard under Network Access.

Common Issues and Solutions
MongoDB Connection Error

Ensure the MongoDB URI is correctly configured in the .env file.
Make sure your IP is whitelisted in MongoDB Atlas.
Missing start Script

Add the following in your package.json if missing:
json
Copy code
"scripts": {
  "start": "node src/app.js",
  "dev": "nodemon src/app.js"
}
ENOTFOUND Error

Verify the MongoDB cluster address in your connection string.
Use a standard connection string if +srv does not work.
Future Enhancements
Add user authentication and authorization.
